A [RoboFont](http:robofont.com) extension that makes switching glyph, space or font windows super easy. Also available on Mechanic2.

## Default keys
The default keys associated with these scripts are:

* `⌘ ⇧ ]` : to the next master
* `⌘ ⇧ [` : to the previous master
* `⌘ ⇧ '` : shuffle

This mimics the `next glyph` on `]` and `previous glyph` on `[`. But of course you should set it to whatever you're used to. 

If you have Skateboard installed, ETNM will ask it for the next/previous routing.
