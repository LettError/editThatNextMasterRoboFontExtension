# editThatNextMasterRoboFontExtension

A RoboFont extension that makes switching glyph, space or font windows super easy.

The default keys associated with these scripts are:

* `⌘ ⇧ ]` : to the next master
* `⌘ ⇧ [` : to the previous master
* `⌘ ⇧ '` : shuffle

This mimics the `next glyph` on `]` and `previous glyph` on `[`. But of course you should set it to whatever you're used to.
